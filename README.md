# My Aurora-dx for embedded development

This repository contains my [bootc](https://github.com/bootc-dev/bootc) image for embedded development.

This is mainly about installing tools and packages I need on the base system for Zephyr and other embedded development, at least until I understand how to do that with devcontainers.

See the [ublue-os image template repos](https://github.com/ublue-os/image-template) for more information about the repos structure and just commands.
